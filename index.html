                I am a software developer living in Houston, Texas, though
                I am originally from a suburban town called West Chester,
                near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Right now I'm working as
                a contractor for
                <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>,
                a web hosting company that's been around since 2002.
                I like working there, and do most of my backend
                development using the
                <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> programming
                language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn't always a software developer or otherwise working
                on computers, though I've been interested in them since I
                was ten years old. I've been an administrative assistant,
                pizza delivery boy, dishwasher, cashier, and various other
                menial jobs prior to happening into a job in Information
                Technology. I much prefer working as a developer!
